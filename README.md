## Thoughtfully designed by fellow developers

### Getting started

To get started, it is **required** to download Pieces OS* from pieces.app/install.

This enables Pieces products to run locally on your machine and manages connections to Pieces plugins. **This plugin
will not work properly without Pieces OS installed and running.**

*_The Pieces OS install includes the Pieces for Developers Desktop App where you can also view and manage your
snippets._
